      Hoon is a esoteric language designed for the peer-to-peer networking platform Urbit. Hoon is a functional language (meaning everything is input-output, with NO side-effects) with a highly idiosyncratic syntax made of what urbiters call 'runes.' |= 'bartis', ++ 'luslus',  and ?> 'wutgar', are a few of the many, many examples. Don't ask me what they do, because I don't remember. I just think hoon is pretty and would love to learn to write it one day.
