          Words! Using the right part of speech are the best, even if the word is long. I hate having to remember weird shorthands for things, odd terminology, or arcane symbols.

          Declarative. I like writing functions named after their purpose or goal, and the feeling that comes from that, like I am delegating down to them, and giving them responsibility.

          Imperative. I like to give very specific instructions in precise order. If I'm not micromanaging the computer, I feel like it's gonna get lazy and stop listening to me.
