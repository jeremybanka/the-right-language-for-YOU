## Description

Having a hard time knowing what computer language would be good? Turn your brain off and let this idiotic quiz choose for you!

Maybe in the year 2020 choosing a programming language would be a tough decision that you would make carefully--based on dumb hokum like 'research' and 'project definition'. Fortunately, in the year 2021, Jeremy Banka has made a quiz website that helps you make that decision based on ineffable aspects of your personality or current mood!

## Setup/Installation Requirements

#### First Things First
* Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/jeremybanka/programming-portfolio`
* Open `index.html` in your favorite web browser

#### SCSS Tooling
* Use VS Code.
* Install VS Code extension "Live Sass Compiler" by Ritwick Dey.
* Enable 'Watch Sass' in your status bar at the bottom of the app.
* Now your changes to the scss will compile to css in real-time!

#### Javascript Tooling
* Use VS Code.
* Install VS Code extension "ESLint" by Dirk Baeumer.
* In the project's root folder, run `npm i` to install required dev dependencies.
* Ensure that your VS Code settings.json has the following properties set:
  + ` "editor.codeActionsOnSave": { \n
        "source.fixAll.eslint": true, \n
      }, // this automates the linting process` 
  + ` "\[javascript]": { \n
      "editor.formatOnSave": true, \n
      "editor.defaultFormatter": "ms-vsliveshare.vsliveshare" \n
    }, // use this rule if you have installed Ritwick Dey's Live Share` 
* Now, my meticulously selected formatting preferences will be applied to files in this repo any time you hit save!
